Convention followed for naming the test classes and test methods is as follows - 

Test Methods - 

[MethodNameUnderTest_StateUnderTestLikeWhatInput_ExpectedBehavior]

It has every information needed on the method name and in a structured manner.

For assemblies use the typical .Tests ending, which is quite widespread and the same for classes (ending with Tests):

[NameOfTheClassUnderTestTests]

This kind of convention is getting more popular now and has been inspired by Roy Osherove's post http://osherove.com/blog/2005/4/3/naming-standards-for-unit-tests.html
